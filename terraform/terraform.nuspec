Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.11.12 (March 8, 2019)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* The `filemd5`, `filesha1`, etc functions from Terraform v0.12 are backported primarily to allow writing
  modules that can work in both Terraform 0.11 and 0.12, since the `sha1(file("..."))` pattern in 0.12
  works only for files containing valid UTF-8 text; `sha1file("...")` must be used instead.  Both
  forms are equivalent in Terraform 0.11.
* backend/remote: Retry calls when the remote backend responds with a server error ([#20589](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20589))
* backend/remote: Check for external updates while waiting for user input ([#20622](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20622))

BUG FIXES:

* backend/remote: Fix "token too long" errors when streaming remote operation logs ([#20241](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20241))
* backend/remote: Use the `can-queue-apply` permission to detect if apply is allowed ([#20462](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20462))
* backend/remote: Exit with 1 when a remote run is canceled ([#20482](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20482))
* core: Use slashes in the module manifest to prevent Windows/Linux compatibility issues ([#20246](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20246))

## 0.11.12-beta1 (January 28, 2019)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* command/state: Use locking when updating states ([#19939](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19939))
* backend/remote: Add support for remote state only organizations ([#20007](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20007))
* backend/remote: Make sure the correct error is shown when having version incompatibilities ([#20086](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20086))

BUG FIXES:

* backend/remote: Fix an error that prevents checking version constraints ([#19668](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19668))
* backend/remote: Compare versions without the prerelease ([#19705](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19705))

    <description>
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.10.7 (October 2, 2017)

NEW FEATURES:

* Provider plugins can now optionally be cached in a shared directory to avoid re-downloading them for each configuration working directory. For more information, see [the documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/34956cd12449cb77db3f55e3286cd369e8332eeb/website/docs/configuration/providers.html.md#provider-plugin-cache). ([#16000](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16000))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* config: New `abs` interpolation function, returning the absolute value of a number ([#16168](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16168))
* config: New `transpose` interpolation function, which swaps the keys and values in a map of lists of strings. ([#16192](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16192))
* cli: The Terraform CLI now supports tab-completion for commands and certain arguments for `bash` and `zsh` users. See [the tab-completion docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/2c782e60fad78e6fc976d850162322608f074e57/website/docs/commands/index.html.markdown#shell-tab-completion) for information on how to enable it. ([#16176](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16176))
* cli: `terraform state rm` now includes in its output the count of resources that were removed from the state. ([#16137](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16137))

BUG FIXES:

* modules: Update go-getter to fix crash when fetching invalid source subdir ([#16161](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16161))
* modules: Fix regression in the handling of modules sourcing other modules with relative paths ([#16160](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16160))
* core: Skip local value interpolation during destroy ([#16213](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16213))

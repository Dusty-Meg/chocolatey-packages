Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.12.6 (July 31, 2019)

NOTES:

* backend/s3: After this update, the AWS Go SDK will prefer credentials found via the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable when both the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable and the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables are statically defined. Previously the SDK would ignore the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable, if static environment credentials were also specified. This is listed as a bug fix in the AWS Go SDK release notes. ([#22253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22253))

NEW FEATURES:
* backend/oss: added support for assume role config ([#22186](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22186))
* config: Resources can now use a for_each meta-argument ([#17179](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17179))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* backend/s3: Add support for assuming role via web identity token via the `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` and `AWS_ROLE_ARN` environment variables ([#22253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22253))
* backend/s3: Support automatic region validation for `me-south-1`. For AWS operations to work in the new region, the region must be explicitly enabled as outlined in the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable) ([#22253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22253))
* connection/ssh: Improve connection debug messages ([#22097](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22097))

BUG FIXES:
* backend/remote: remove misleading contents from error message ([#22148](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22148))
* backend/s3: Load credentials via the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable (if available) when `AWS_PROFILE` is defined along with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` ([#22253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22253))
* config: Improve conditionals to returns the correct type when dynamic values are present but unevaluated ([#22137](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22137))
* config: Fix panic when mistakingly using `dynamic` on an attribute ([#22169](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22169))
* cli: Fix crash with reset connection during init ([#22146](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22146))
* cli: show all deposed instances and prevent crash in `show` command ([#22149](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22149))
* configs/configupgrade: Fix crash with nil hilNode ([#22181](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22181))
* command/fmt: now formats correctly in presence of here-docs ([#21434](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21434))
* helper/schema: don't skip deprecation check during validation when attribute value is unknown ([#22262](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22262))
* plugin/sdk: allow MinItems > 1 when dynamic blocks ([#22221](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22221))
* plugin/sdk: fix reflect panics in helper/schema validation ([#22236](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22236))

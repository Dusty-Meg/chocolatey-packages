Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.12.0 (May 22, 2019)

---

This is the aggregated summary of changes compared to v0.11.14. If you'd like to see the incremental changelog through each of the v0.12.0 prereleases, please refer to [the v0.12.0-rc1 changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.12.0-rc1/CHANGELOG.md).

---

The focus of v0.12.0 was on improvements to the Terraform language made in response to all of the feedback and experience gathered on prior versions. We hope that these language improvements will help to make configurations for more complex situations more readable, and improve the usability of re-usable modules.

However, an overhaul of this kind inevitably means that 100% compatibility is not possible. The updated language is designed to be broadly compatible with the 0.11 language as documented, but some of the improvements required a slightly stricter parser and language model in order to resolve ambiguity or to give better feedback in error messages.

If you are upgrading to v0.12.0, we strongly recommend reading [the upgrade guide](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html) to learn the recommended upgrade process, which includes a tool to automatically upgrade many improved language constructs and to indicate situations where human intuition is required to complete the upgrade.

    <description>
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.9.0 (March 15, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* provider/aws: `aws_codebuild_project` renamed `timeout` to `build_timeout` ([#12503](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12503))
* provider/azurem: `azurerm_virtual_machine` and `azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set` now store has of `custom_data` not all `custom_data` ([#12214](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12214))
* provider/azurerm: `scale_sets` `os_profile_master_password` now marked as sensitive
* provider/azurerm: `sql_server` `administrator_login_password` now marked as sensitive
* provider/dnsimple: Provider has been upgraded to APIv2 therefore, you will need to use the APIv2 auth token
* provider/google: storage buckets have been updated with the new storage classes. The old classes will continue working as before, but should be migrated as soon as possible, as there's no guarantee they'll continue working forever. ([#12044](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12044))
* provider/google: `compute_instance`, `compute_instance_template`, and `compute_disk` all have a subtly changed logic when specifying an image family as the image; in 0.8.x they would pin to the latest image in the family when the resource is created; in 0.9.x they pass the family to the API and use its behaviour. New input formats are also supported. ([#12223](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12223))
* provider/google: removed the unused and deprecated region field from `google_compute_backend_service` ([#12663](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12663))
* provider/google: removed the deprecated `account_file` field for the Google Cloud provider ([#12668](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12668))
* provider/google: removed the deprecated fields from `google_project` ([#12659](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12659))

FEATURES:

* **Remote Backends:** This is a successor to "remote state" and includes file-based configuration, an improved setup process (just run `terraform init`), no more local caching of remote state, and more. ([#11286](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11286))
* **Destroy Provisioners:** Provisioners can now be configured to run on resource destruction. ([#11329](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11329))
* **State Locking:** State will be automatically locked when supported by the backend. Backends supporting locking in this release are Local, S3 (via DynamoDB), and Consul. ([#11187](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11187))
* **State Environments:** You can now create named "environments" for states. This allows you to manage distinct infrastructure resources from the same configuration.
* **New Provider:**  `Circonus` ([#12578](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12578))
* **New Data Source:**  `openstack_networking_network_v2` ([#12304](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12304))
* **New Resource:**  `aws_iam_account_alias` ([#12648](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12648))
* **New Resource:**  `datadog_downtime` ([#10994](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10994))
* **New Resource:**  `ns1_notifylist` ([#12373](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12373))
* **New Resource:**  `google_container_node_pool` ([#11802](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11802))
* **New Resource:**  `rancher_certificate` ([#12717](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12717))
* **New Resource:**  `rancher_host` ([#11545](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11545))
* helper/schema: Added Timeouts to allow Provider/Resource developers to expose configurable timeouts for actions ([#12311](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12311))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* core: Data source values can now be used as part of a `count` calculation. ([#11482](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11482))

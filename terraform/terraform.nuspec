Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.12.10 (October 07, 2019)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` will now warn when the `-target` option is used, to draw attention to the fact that the result of applying the plan is likely to be incomplete, and to remind to re-run `terraform plan` with no targets afterwards to ensure that the configuration has converged. ([#22783](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22783))
* config: New function `parseint` for parsing strings containing digits as integers in various bases. ([#22747](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22747))
* config: New function `cidrsubnets`, which is a companion to the existing function `cidrsubnet` which can allocate multiple consecutive subnet prefixes (possibly of different prefix lengths) in a single call. ([#22858](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22858))
* backend/google: The GCS backend now supports OAuth2 token authentication. ([#21772](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21772))
* provisioner/habitat: Multiple updates and fixes, see PR for details ([#22705](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22705))

BUG FIXES:

* backend/manta: fix panic when `insecure_skip_tls_verify` was not set ([#22918](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22918))

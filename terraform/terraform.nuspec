    <description>
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.8.0 (December 13, 2016)

**This is the complete 0.7.13 to 0.8 CHANGELOG. Below this section we
also have a 0.8.0-rc3 to 0.8.0 final CHANGELOG.**

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* `template_file` _inline_ templates must escape their variable usage. What was previously `${foo}` must now be `$${foo}`. Note that this is only for _inline_ templates. Templates read from files are unchanged. ([#9698](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9698))
* Escape sequences used to require double-escaping when used within interpolations. You now must only escape once (which is the expected/typical behavior). For example: `${replace(var.foo, "\\", "\\\\")}` is correct. Before, that would cause very strange behavior. However, this may break existing configurations which found a level of escape sequences to work. Check `terraform plan` for incorrect output.
* Math operators now follow the standard order of operations: *, /, % followed by +, -. See the updated interpolation docs for more information. You can continue to force ordering with parentheses.
* Strings in configuration can no longer contain unescaped newlines. For unescaped newlines, heredocs must be used

* provider/aws: Anywhere where we can specify kms_key_id must now be a valid KMS Key ID ARN to stop continual diffs
* provider/chef: The chef provider now accepts `key_material` as an alternative to `private_key_pem`. The `private_key_pem` attribute will be deprecated in a  future release
* provider/postgres: `ssl_mode` has been renamed `sslmode` to match common usage ([#10682](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10682))

DEPRECATION REMOVALS:

* The `template_file` resource no longer accepts a direct file path for the `template` attribute. You may either specify a path wrapped in a `file` function or specify a file path with the `filepath` attribute. This was deprecated during 0.7.x.

FEATURES:

* **New command:** `terraform console`, an interactive console for experimenting with and using interpolations. ([#10093](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10093))
* **Terraform version requirement in configuration.** You can now specify a Terraform version requirement in configuration and modules. ([#10080](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10080))
* **Conditional values:** You can now use conditionals to determine the values of attributes. For example: `count = "${var.env == "prod" ? 1 : 0}"`.
* **`depends_on` can reference modules.** This allows a resource or output to depend on everything within a module. ([#10076](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10076))
* **`output` supports `depends_on`.** This is useful when the output depends on a certain ordering to happen that can't be represented with interpolations. ([#10072](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10072))
* Providers and resources are now notified by Terraform core to "stop" when an interrupt is received, allowing resources to gracefully exit much, much faster. ([#9607](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9607))
* The `import` command can now specify a provider alias to use. ([#10310](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10310))
* The `import` command will now read provider configuration from Terraform configuration files (including loading tfvars files and so on). ([#9809](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9809))

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.11.1 (November 30, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* modules: Modules can now receive a specific provider configuration in the `providers` map, even if it's only implicitly used ([#16619](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16619))
* config: Terraform will now detect and warn about outputs containing potentially-problematic references to resources with `count` set where the references does not use the "splat" syntax. This identifies situations where an output may [reference a resource with `count = 0`](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-11.html#referencing-attributes-from-resources-with-count-0) even if the `count` expression does not _currently_ evaluate to `0`, allowing the bug to be detected and fixed _before_ the value is later changed to `0` and would thus become an error. **This usage will become a fatal error in Terraform 0.12**. ([#16735](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16735))
* core: A new environment variable `TF_WARN_OUTPUT_ERRORS=1` is supported to opt out of the behavior introduced in 0.11.0 where errors in output expressions halt execution. This restores the previous behavior where such errors are ignored, allowing users to apply problematic configurations without fixing all of the errors. This opt-out will be removed in Terraform 0.12, so it is strongly recommended to use the new warning described in the previous item to detect and fix these problematic expressions. ([#16782](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16782))

BUG FIXES:

* cli: fix crash when subcommands with sub-subcommands are accidentally provided as a single argument, such as `terraform "workspace list"` ([#16789](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16789))

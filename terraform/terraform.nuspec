    <description>
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

## 0.7.3 (September 5, 2016)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
* Terraform now validates the uniqueness of variable and output names in your configuraitons. In prior versions certain ways of duplicating variable names would work. This is now a configuration error (and should've always been). If you get an error running Terraform you may need to remove the duplicates. Done right, this should not affect the behavior of Terraform.
* The internal structure of `.terraform/modules` changed slightly. For configurations with modules, you'll need to run `terraform get` again.

FEATURES:

* **New Provider:** `rabbitmq` ([#7694](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/7694))

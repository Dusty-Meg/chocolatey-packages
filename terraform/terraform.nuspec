Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.10.4 (September 6, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:
* `terraform apply` now uses the standard resource address syntax to refer to resources in its log ([#15884](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15884))
* `terraform plan` output has some minor adjustments to improve readability and accessibility for those who can't see its colors ([#15884](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15884))

BUG FIXES:

* backend/consul: fix crash during consul backend initialization ([#15976](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15976))
* backend/azurerm: ensure that blob storage metadata is preserved when updating state blobs, to avoid losing track of lock metadata ([#16015](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16015))
* config: local values now work properly in resource `count` and in modules with more than one `.tf` file ([#15995](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15995)] [[#15982](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15982))
* cli: removed some inconsistencies in how data sources are counted and tallied in plan vs. apply and apply vs. destroy. In particular, data sources are no longer incorrectly counted as destroyed in `terraform destroy` ([#15884](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15884))

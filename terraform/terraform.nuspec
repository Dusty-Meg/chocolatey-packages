Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

## 0.7.10 (November 9, 2016)

FEATURES:

* **New Resource:** `azurerm_eventhub` ([#9889](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9889))
* **New Resource:** `azurerm_virtual_machine_extension` ([#9962](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9962))
* **Experimental new plan graph:** `terraform plan` is getting a new graph creation process for 0.8. This is now available behind a flag `-Xnew-apply` (on any command). This will become the default in 0.8. There may still be bugs. ([#9973](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9973))
IMPROVEMENTS:

* provider/aws: Add support for Service Access Security Group in `aws_emr_cluster` ([#9600](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9600))
* provider/aws: Add Enhanced VPC routing to Redshift ([#9950](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9950))
* provider/aws: Add key_name_prefix argument to aws_key_pair resource ([#9993](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9993))
* provider/openstack: Add `value_specs` to `openstack_fw_policy_v1` resource, allowing vendor information ([#9835](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9835))
* provider/openstack: Add `value_specs` to `openstack_fw_firewall_v1` resource, allowing vendor information ([#9836](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9836))
* provider/random: The `b64` attribute on `random_id` resources is deprecated, replaced by `b64_url` and `b64_std` ([#9903](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9903))

BUG FIXES:

* core: Splat variables (`foo.*.bar`) are now ordered by count index for deterministic ordering. ([#9883](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9883))
* core: Prune orphan outputs (in the config but not in the state). ([#9971](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9971))
* core: New apply graph doesn't prune module variables as aggressively. ([#9898](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9898))
* core: New apply graph properly configures providers with aliases. ([#9894](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9894))
* core: New destroy graph doesn't create edge loops to destroy nodes that reference themselves. ([#9968](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9968))
* provider/aws: Fix crash when adding EBS volumes to spot fleet request. ([#9857](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9857))
* provider/aws: Ignore NoSuchEntity error when IAM user does not have login profile ([#9900](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9900))
* provider/aws: Setting static_routes_only on import of vpn_connection ([#9802](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9802))
* provider/aws: aws_alb_target_group arn_suffix missing the targetgroup ([#9911](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9911))
* provider/aws: Fix the validateFunc of aws_elasticache_replication_group ([#9918](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9918))
* provider/aws: removing toLower when setting aws_db_parameter_group options ([#9820](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9820))
* provider/aws: Fix panic when passing statuses to aws_acm_certificate ([#9990](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9990))
* provider/aws: AWS IAM, User and Role allow + in the name ([#9991](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9991))
* provider/scaleway: retry volume attachment ([#9972](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9972))
* provider/scaleway: fix `scaleway_image` datasource returning unknown images ([#9899](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9899))
* provider/google: fix crash when mistakenly configuring disks ([#9942](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9942))

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

## 0.12.7 (August 22, 2019)

NEW FEATURES:
* New functions `regex` and `regexall` allow applying a regular expression pattern to a string and retrieving any matching substring(s) ([#22353](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22353))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* lang/funcs: `lookup()` can work with maps of lists, maps and objects ([#22269](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22269))
* SDK: helper/acctest: Add function to return random IP address ([#22312](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22312))
* SDK: httpclient: Introduce composable `UserAgent(version)` ([#22272](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22272))
* connection/ssh: Support certificate authentication ([#22156](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22156))

BUG FIXES:
* config: reduce MinIems and MaxItems  validation during decoding, to allow for use of dynamic blocks ([#22530](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22530))
* config: don't validate MinItems and MaxItems in CoerceValue, allowing providers to set incomplete values ([#22478](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22478))
* config: fix panic on tuples with `for_each` ([#22279](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22279))
* config: fix references to `each` of `for_each` in provisioners ([#22289](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22289))
* config: fix panic when using nested dynamic blocks ([#22314](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22314))
* config: ensure consistent evaluation when moving between single resources and `for_each` in addressing ([#22454](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22454))
* core: only start a single instance of each required provisioner ([#22553](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22553))
* command: fix issue where commands occasionally exited before the error message printed ([#22373](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22373))
* command/0.12upgrade: use user-supplied plugin-dir ([#22306](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22306))
* command/hook_ui: Truncate the ID considering multibyte characters ([#18823](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18823))
* command/fmt: Terraform fmt no longer inserts spaces after % ([#22356](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22356))
* command/state: Allow moving resources to modules not yet in state ([#22299](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22299))
* backend/google: Now using the OAuth2 token endpoint on `googleapis.com` instead of `google.com`. These endpoints are equivalent in functionality but `googleapis.com` hosts are resolvable from private Google Cloud Platform VPCs where other connectivity is restricted. ([#22451](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22451))
